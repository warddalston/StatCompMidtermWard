Package: BMAPack
Title: Performing Bayesian Model Averaging
Description: This package performs a Bayesian Model Averaging routine on simple
    regressions.  Creates a BMA class, a function to fit BMA objects, 3
    separate get methods to extract BMA slot elements, and a summary and plot
    method for BMA objects. The BMA includes a large coefficient matrix, the
    model odds for each fitted model, the expected value of each coefficient,
    and the probability that that each coefficient is non-zero.
